Climate Monitoring System - A live working project on IoT &amp; ML which predicts or forecasts upcoming weather for the next five days using historical data by some ML algorithms and live reading of temperature by various sensors.

I personally worked on the IoT part in this project and my friend helped with all the ML stuff.
